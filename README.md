# CourseConnect

## About
On the eve of the next semester of the school year, students often share this data with their friends and family through numerous different forms of social media, resulting in an inconvenient mess of sending screenshots and switching between different media to broadcast their classes and chat with friends about their future teachers/professors and course material. CourseConnect aims to resolve that issue by providing a single interface for students to display their courses and have the opportunity to view their friends' courses as well either by following them or by enrolling in the same class structure.

## Version 0.1
The current version of CourseConnect only provides a sampling of the user interface as of December 3rd, 2017.
